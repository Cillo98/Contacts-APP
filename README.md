# Contacts-APP
Android app for managing Contacts using a Database SQLite.
This is my first Android APP. I started writing it in early January and have been working on it for about three weeks.

It contains activities to:
1. list all the contacts with an adapter that gets entries from a SQLite database and pushes them into a scrollable list;
2. display a contact once it's clicked from the main activity (#1);
3. create a new contact to be added to the database. New contacts must contain at least a name/surname and at least one of
the following: phone number, mobile number, address, email
